# GameEngine is a simple 2.5D game engine based on sprites.
## Introduction
### The philosophy
The idea behind this project was and is to recreate a game engine similar to id tech 0 or the engines used by DOOM and DOOM 2. I am not a good programmer yet, and thus my code style is very strange.
### The project goal and structure
This engine is designed to be very fast, allow experienced users to take control over for optimisations. You mat see code repetition and that is because most of the times it is faster that way.
Curently the project is split into 4 parts:
1. GameEngine - The main part.
2. Renderer - The rendering part.
3. Scaler - Image manipulation utils.
4. Tests - Various c++ executable test files to showcase functions
But first, let me tell you how to clone this repo and get going.
## Building
First clone the repo:
$ git clone
